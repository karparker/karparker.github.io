			<p> Hi!  I am Karissa Parker.  Born in Iowa, raised in North Carolina.  The south is the place to be!</p>
			<p>I currently work at <a href="https://www.jackrabbittech.com" target="_blank">Jackrabbit Technologies</a> as Sales Manager, a cloud-based accounts receivable software for children's activity centers. <br><br> Along with my 8-5 job I also have some fun where I turned a hobby in to a small business.  You can find me at <a href="portfolioshop.html">Precisely Perfect Designs</a> on Facebook and Etsy creating customized items for you and your home. <br><br> As if those did not keep me busy enough I have taken on the adventure of website development and I can't wait to learn more!</p>
			<p>This is me, obviously, taking a hike in the Blue Mountains of Australia.</p>
